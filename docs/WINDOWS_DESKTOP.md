# SELENE Windows Desktop

SELENE Windows is a small native WPF collector that runs in the current Windows
user session. It is intentionally a tray application rather than a service:
this keeps installation simple, avoids administrator privileges, and makes the
collection boundary visible and controllable to the user.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 version 22H2 or Windows 11, x64.
- The published single-file package does not require a separate .NET runtime.
- Development builds require .NET SDK 9.0.
- No administrator permission is requested.
- Android remote sync uses official Syncthing and installs it through winget
  when an explicit pairing-code action finds it absent.

## First Run

1. Extract the SELENE-0.5.4-windows-x64.zip archive to a normal user folder.
2. Run SELENE.Windows.exe.
3. Choose a parent export folder. This can be the same folder used by Android
   SELENE, although each platform writes its own immutable snapshot directories.
4. Leave automatic collection enabled and choose 5, 15, 30, or 60 minutes.
5. Enable Windows startup only when running the published executable. Debug
   runs intentionally do not write a startup entry.

Closing the window hides SELENE in the system tray. The tray menu can show the
window, trigger an immediate collection, or exit the process. A snapshot is
written only while the application is running; the startup option is the
supported way to keep it available after login.

## One-Time Android Pairing

SELENE Windows owns the **Android one-time pairing** panel; the Syncthing Web UI
is not needed:

1. Select or confirm the Receive Only inbox and enable start-at-login.
2. Generate a code. SELENE prepares Syncthing, a random certificate, one-use
   token, and a five-minute listener.
3. On one trusted LAN, scan with Android SELENE or paste the text code.

Pairing preparation, temporary-certificate creation, and QR encoding run off
the UI thread. SELENE caches the validated Syncthing path, inbox, and device ID
for the current process. It writes `HYPERION_SELENE_INBOX` only when the value has
actually changed; the first write uses a direct registry update and a bounded
background system notification so an unresponsive window cannot stall QR
generation for many seconds.
4. After the phone returns its device ID, Windows approves it and shares data
   `selene-inbox-v1` plus reverse acknowledgement `selene-ack-v1`.

Every ten seconds SELENE reports paired/connected device counts and LAN versus
remote routes. A complete snapshot is verified file by file and atomically
copied into a separate durable Archive before an ACK is emitted;
`HYPERION_SELENE_INBOX` points to that Archive. Android deletes a phone copy only
after a matching ACK and one day of retention. Restart HYPERION once after initial
enrollment. Cross-network sync and in-place updates need no second scan. See
[P2P_SYNC.md](P2P_SYNC.md) for protocol, security, and troubleshooting.

## Collected Signals and Choices

Each interval produces a new SELENE-v1-UTC-timestamp directory containing one
context-events.json file. By default, the Windows collector records:

- foreground process name and start/end time for sessions observed by SELENE;
- aggregate foreground seconds and distinct active application count;
- current idle duration from GetLastInputInfo;
- battery percentage when Windows reports it, charging state and AC state;
- whether a network is available and its coarse transport (wifi, ethernet, vpn,
  other, or none).

The “Collection scope and privacy boundary” panel exposes an explicit switch
for each field group. Window titles, executable paths, and the current
foreground browser URL are off by default. Every snapshot includes a
`collection-profile` event listing the selections used for that snapshot.

Foreground activity is an observed interval. Device state, network state, and
the collection profile are point-in-time samples: their `startAt` and `endAt`
are the capture instant, so they never claim an unobserved interval across an
application restart. Every capture allocates new event IDs, including two
captures that happen within the same system clock millisecond.

Event timestamps use the Windows system timezone and ISO 8601 offset, such as
`2026-08-06T22:54:39.123+08:00`. Snapshot directory names remain UTC for stable
sorting. The JSON is compact UTF-8; SELENE reports the written byte count after
each capture.

The process name is the executable name such as chrome or devenv. Window
titles, paths, and URLs are written only after the user enables their switches,
and are tagged `sensitive`. URL capture is a best-effort read of the address
bar of the current foreground browser; it cannot guarantee every tab or
navigation and may include query parameters. SELENE does not read page bodies,
forms, process arguments, keystrokes, clipboard data, notifications, chat
databases, SMS, calls, screenshots, or payment history. Sessions shorter than
five seconds are not emitted as individual activity events, although they
remain part of the bounded aggregate when observed.

Windows SELENE does not currently read calendar databases, precise location,
notification contents, or application-specific usage histories. Those sources
remain platform-specific and are intentionally not approximated with
unreliable scraping.

For Android background movement tracking, including its separate permission
and foreground-service boundary, see [ANDROID_MOVEMENT.md](ANDROID_MOVEMENT.md).

## Data and Privacy

Settings are stored in:

~~~text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\SELENE\desktop-settings.json
~~~

Diagnostics contain event names, timestamps, and error messages only:

~~~text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\SELENE\logs\selene-YYYYMMDD.log
~~~

The raw timeline is written only to the export folder chosen by the user.
SELENE never scans that folder before writing, never merges old events, never
rewrites an existing JSON file, and never deletes an old snapshot. The JSON is
written as a flushed temporary file and atomically renamed only when complete,
so an importer does not observe a half-written document. If the application is
forcibly terminated before that rename, the temporary file is deliberately not
treated as an immutable snapshot.

Unwritten foreground sessions are checkpointed under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SELENE`
and acknowledged only after a snapshot has been flushed. A sudden process
termination, power failure, or the still-active sampling interval can still
lose data; zero loss cannot be guaranteed by a user-session application.

The snapshot uses:

~~~json
{
  "schema": "selene-context-events/v1",
  "device": { "platform": "windows" },
  "producer": {
    "name": "SELENE",
    "version": "0.5.4",
    "layout": "immutable-snapshot-v1"
  },
  "events": []
}
~~~

HYPERION receives only the coarse model projection. Exact coordinates and
address-like fields, when present in another SELENE platform's local data,
are not sent to the model.

## Troubleshooting

If no new folder appears, verify that the selected parent directory still
exists and that SELENE is visible in the tray. If the folder is on a removable
drive, use a stable local directory instead. A failed write is recorded in the
daily log; the application remains available for an immediate retry.

If Windows startup was enabled for an old extracted directory, disable it in
the SELENE window before moving or deleting that directory. The startup entry
is stored under the current user's Run key and does not affect other users.

## Development

~~~powershell
dotnet build desktop\SELENE.Windows\SELENE.Windows.csproj -c Release
dotnet run --project desktop\SELENE.Windows.ContractTests\SELENE.Windows.ContractTests.csproj -c Release
dotnet publish desktop\SELENE.Windows\SELENE.Windows.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:PublishTrimmed=false -o releases\SELENE-0.5.4-windows-x64
~~~

The contract test writes two snapshots using the same timestamp and asserts
that their directories differ and that the first JSON remains byte-for-byte
unchanged.
